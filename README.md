Hello!

I'm just a passerby who likes to write and code, and is also a big fan of the show MLP!
Some of my interests include coding, writing, skiing (as I live in Canada), reading, and debating philosophy
The coding languages I know right now are Python, a bit of C++, and I want to learn Rust.
I always want to have a happy take on life, and negativity has no place in my day!
Have an awesome day, or week, and may you have the best fortune!
